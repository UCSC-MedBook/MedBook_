Upload to Wrangler
==================

Prerequisites:
  python 2.7

Usage:
  uploadToWrangler.py configurationFile sampleID

Example:
  uploadToWrangler.py example.conf KS_10

Setup:
  The first line of the script must be edited to provide the path to
  your system's python 2.7 executable.

  A configuration file must be supplied with the details about where the
  sample files are located and what they are named. See the included
  example.conf file for details. 
  
  The following directory structure is assumed:
-- [A base directory containing all sample directories]
  -- [A directory named the same as the sampleID ]
    -- [some number of subdirectories with the same name for every sample]
      -- [the desired sample file]

 The desired sample file is assumed to be named [sampleID].suffix, with the
 same suffix for every sample.
  
Running the script:

This script uploads a file that is to be imported as a MedBook Wrangler
submission. Once completed, it will display 
the ID that it has been assigned. For example:

Blob ID for import to Wrangler:
{"_id":"AbCdEfGh12345"}

On Wrangler's Submissions / Edit page, you will see a field with the prompt
"Enter blob ID". Enter into this field the ID you received; in this example,
the ID is AbCdEfGh12345. Then, click the "Import blob" button and the uploaded
file will be attached to that Wrangler submission.
