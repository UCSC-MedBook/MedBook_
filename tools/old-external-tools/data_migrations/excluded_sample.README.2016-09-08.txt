Code that was used to create 27 sample groups.
We started with a cohort of 27 samples; for each sample group,
one of those samples was omitted from the cohort & the group was
labeled with the excluded sample.

Genericized for future use.

1. make oneline.txt containing:

{"collaborations": ["(email omitted)", "(email omitted)"], "data_sets": [{"data_set_id": "(id omitted)", "filters": [{"type": "exclude_sample_list", "options": {"sample_labels": ["(namespace)/SAMPLENAME"], "sample_count": 1}}]}], "version": 1, "name": "- SAMPLENAME excluded from (original sample group)"},

2. make samples.txt with one samplename per line.

3. run the following script to make a list of the sample group objects to add in sampleLines.txt

while read line; do sed -e "s/SAMPLENAME/$line/g" < oneline.txt >> sampleLines.txt ; done < samples.txt

4. Insert into final code framework below and run as a snippet in chrome.

var sgroups = [

 // list goes here

]

  for( item of sgroups){
    Meteor.call("createSampleGroup", item, (e,r) => {
      if(e){console.log("ERROR ",e);}
      else{console.log("RAN ",r);} 
    });
  }
