Task:
When the existing CKCC Reference Cohort was imported into MedBook, two filters
were applied to it before import which dropped some genes from the cohort.
Medbook now has the capability to apply those filters on the fly, so a new
copy of the reference cohort was imported, which did not have those filters
applied.

Then, for each sample group which referred to the original copy of the cohort,
a new version of that sample group was created referring to the new cohort.
